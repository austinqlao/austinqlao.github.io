Assignment 2 is a project that fully utilizes our previously completetd, Assignmnet 1 tasks you to implement many course content topics including data validation, data persistence and passwords encryption, and website personalization. People are also individually tasked to complete specific IR's which is an extra mandatory requirement. I specifically had IR3: When the user is registering, suggest a “strong” password that is 10 random characters including numbers and special characters.

This project was a thorough exploration of web application development, with a focus on security and user data management. I gained knowledge on how to manage user login and registration procedures safely while maintaining data security and permanence. Controlling user sessions without the use of cookies or session management software proved to be especially difficult and instructive.

In order to improve my programming abilities, I must address inefficiencies in the detection and correction of bugs. In particular, I had to deal with extended debugging periods, particularly in a big scenario where information had to be sent from a textbox to the server in order to create an invoice. I intend to improve my debugging skills in order to expedite this process, maybe by honing my comprehension of server-side interactions and extensively testing input/output methods. My goal is to make my code more resilient overall and spend less time troubleshooting by concentrating on these areas.

Whenever I ran into problems, I looked to internet forums and documentation for assistance, particularly with front-end design and form validation. I referred to the previous course material and screencasts for complicated problems. This strategy was crucial in overcoming challenges with user input validation and responsive design.

Here is my estimated % of effort I put into this.
- Contemplating the implementation of features: 30%
- Writing code: 40% (not including testing)
- Debugging and testing: 30% The intricacy of the project is reflected in its distribution, which necessitates thorough planning, substantial code, and stringent testing to guarantee functioning and security.

I would devote more time to comprehending and putting advanced security measures into practice if I could repeat the task. In order to improve user experience across various devices, I would also make an investment in learning more about responsive web design.
