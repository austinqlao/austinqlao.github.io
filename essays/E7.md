1. Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context

- Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context
Early in the course, during the 'Web Page Basics' and 'Variables and Data Types' modules, I began my journey into programming. The hands-on labs provided a practical framework to apply what was taught in lectures. For instance, when we were tasked with creating a simple calculator using JavaScript, it was crucial to understand how variables and functions interact within a web page. This exercise solidified my understanding of basic programming constructs, such as loops, conditionals, and functions, within real-world IT applications.

- Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge
In the 'Server Side Processing' module, I learned how back-end programming supports the front-end experience and overall business operations. By writing server-side scripts that processed data from HTML forms, I understood how MIS roles intertwine with IT development to improve efficiencies and solve business problems. This knowledge emphasized why a solid foundation in programming is indispensable for managing information systems effectively.

- Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications
Assignment 2, which involved building a fully functional e-store with user authentication and data management, was a cornerstone of my practical education in software development. Starting from scratch, defining the user requirements, and translating them into a working application taught me about the software development lifecycle firsthand. This assignment not only enhanced my programming skills but also my ability to visualize and execute a complete project from idea to implementation.

- Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions
By the end of ITM 352, my confidence in tackling MIS issues had significantly grown. This was particularly evident during the 'Cookies and Sessions' module, where I successfully implemented session management to maintain user states across web pages. The ability to apply theoretical knowledge practically in creating solutions that enhanced user experience and security showed me that I am capable of handling complex MIS problems.

- Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues
The course structure promoted teamwork, especially in assignments where we were grouped to collaborate on developing parts of our applications. Managing different aspects of the projects, from initial planning sessions to final integrations, mimicked real-world IT project management scenarios. This experience was invaluable, as it taught me not just about software development, but also about managing timelines, resources, and team dynamics.

- Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems
Throughout the course, I encountered various MIS problems, particularly during the debugging and file I/O modules. One specific challenge was integrating third-party APIs to handle payment processing, which initially led to several errors. Tackling these issues required thorough testing and adaptation, skills critical for any MIS professional. Solving these problems provided deep insights into typical MIS coding challenges and their solutions.




2. Course Elements and Personal Engagement 
- What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?
After creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 453, I have been able to keep track of my work progress for this class whilst also being able to reference it for my resume! At first, I thought it would be quite difficult to create a professional website like this but it was actually extremely easy after utilizing github.com's website hosting and Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware static site generator. It was also very interesting to be able to look at my fellow classmates and other previous students to see what thier experiences were with the assignments that we had to complete.
  
- What did you gain from doing the WODs?
For the Wods, I really disliked doing them because of how long it took. Despite this, being able to retry the WOD over and over until I was able to complete the task at hand helped me learn the material hands on.

- Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?
I personally didn't feel like they didn't help me that much for the labs. Most of the time, I feel like when I finished the quizzes, all of that information I interpereted just dissipated.

- What did you learn from doing the labs?
Througout all off the labs, they helped me to understand the content from that specific module. It also helped me to be motivated to come and pay attention in class. I also feel like it made improve on my careful reading and following direction skills. Sometimes, trying to complete  a lab through just the reading and what we learned in class has had was quite difficult and frustrating since the material we learned in class is implied learning.

- What did you learn from doing the essays?
When completing the essays, it helped me to reflect on the concepts that I had difficulties with as well as an outlet for me to express my frustrations. I learned that being able to release your frustrations is very healthy with the very foreign concepts that this class offers.

- What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?
From both Assignment 1 and Assignment 2, we had to make our own e-commerce stores. This included the use of security measures and the use of persistent data which I had no knowledge of when first starting assignment 2. Afterwards, I am now able to conceputalize these two segements, but I still do have some trouble understanding them at times.





3. Challenges and Achievements
- Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.
One of the main issues that I had with this class would be how it is organized and its lack of clarity of due dates. There were many times where the due date on laulima was posted, although in class, it there were times where he said that an assignemnt was due on a different date.

- Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.
To overcome these challenges I specifically had to reach out to my classmates or even the Professor himself to make sure of the due dates. I also had to make a seperate calendar of all the updated due dates.

- Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.
One thing that I am proud of during this class was my score for assignment 1, I managed to get 4.2/4.0 which I was very proud of.

4. Skill Development and Application
- Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application) and discuss your progression through these levels.
For syntactic, I feel like I had progressed steadily because I already had some background in html and css. For JavaScript, I had a very hard time learning the syntax. For the algorithmic level, I feel like it wasn't necessarily difficult but it was super tedious to learn. I had a hard time getting my brain to understand how the different pathways would affect the outcome. For application, this was hands on the most difficult thing to learn. Througout assignment 2, I had an extremely difficult time getting the task completed because of my lack of motivation to work through all of the issues I was having. The amount of time that it takes in order to debug your program could range from 10 minutes to 2 hours.

- Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.
Before taking ITM 352, I didn't understand coding at all or how to understand or use any type of back end processing. Througout the process, I am finally able to locate where any issues may lie within a program through VS code.




5. Use of AI (e.g. ChatGBT)
- Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.
AI has helped me complete my work because of how it can explain specific lines of code that I dont understand. When looking at the repository of the in class labs we did, I used it to explain every line of code so I wouldn't get lost.

- Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.
When using Ai, I feel like sometimes I may have overused it when creating the base online store. Sometimes it would add extra lines of uneccessary code and it would ultimately make the end product irregular and inconsistent.
